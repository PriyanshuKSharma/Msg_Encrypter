WebSocket Chat Application: <br>
A simple chat application using WebSocket, Node.js, and HTML/JavaScript for real-time communication between client and server.<br>
### WebSocket Chat Application
This project demonstrates a simple WebSocket-based chat application implemented using Node.js with Express for the server-side and HTML/JavaScript for the client-side.

### Features:
Real-time Communication: Utilizes WebSocket technology to establish a real-time bidirectional communication channel between the client and server.<br>
Client-Server Interaction: Allows users to send text messages from the client interface to the server, and vice versa.<br>
Easy to Use: Simple user interface with an input field and a send button for sending messages.<br>
Logging: Logs messages exchanged between the client and server for debugging purposes.

### Project Structure:
Client: Contains the HTML file (index.html) with JavaScript code for the client-side interface.
<br>
Server: Includes the server-side JavaScript file (server.js) implementing the WebSocket server using Express and ws.

### Usage:
1] Clone the repository to your local machine.<br>
2] Navigate to the server directory and run node server.js to start the WebSocket server.<br>
3] Open a separate terminal, navigate to the client directory, and open index.html in a web browser.<br>
4] Start typing messages in the input field, and click "Send" to send messages to the server.<br>
5] Messages sent from the client will be logged on both the client and server sides, and the server will respond with a "Thank you!" message.
